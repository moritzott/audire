# Audire - Audio Response

## About

Audire is a JS library for audio responsive
web pages. Error messages, success messages,
disabled buttons,... can give an audio response which can help disabled persons (such as blind persons) to interact better with your frontend.

## How does it work?

Audire uses the Web Audio API to create oscillators and tones. The aim is to provide different sounds for errors, successes, and so on, written in JavaScript.
